                        Yoga is a physical, mental and spiritual practice that originated in ancient India. First codified by the sage Patanjali in his Yoga Sutras around 400 C.E, the practice was in fact handed down from teacher to student long before this text arose. Traditionally, this was a one-to-one transmission, but since yoga became popular in the West in the 20th century, group classes have become the norm.

The word yoga is derived from the Sanskrit root yuj, meaning “to yoke,”
 or “to unite”. The practice aims to create union between body, mind 
 and spirit, as well as between the individual self and universal
 
 consciousness. Such a union tends to neutralize ego-driven thoughts
  and behaviours, creating a sense of spiritual awakening.

                   <h6>ABOUT THE PAGE</h6>
                        <p>What we eat is what makes our body and mind. Every cell in the body and every thought in the mind is made by the food from mother nature. If we have polluted everything from water, air, soil, seeds, leaves, vegetables, and fruits then our body and mind will also be polluted.

                            During covid lockdowns we decided to grow 100 % organic produce in the ashram. We neither wanted to use pesticide nor fertilizer nor GMO seeds. Instead, we acquired traditionally preserved seeds, ashram cow dung, cow urine, and some other natural leaves of trees in the ashram.
                            
                            We are successfully growing a wide range of produce now including fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes, beans and grains. We feel it is extremely important to continue with this and are also trying to make our ashram as sustainable as possible. We now have the majority of our energy coming from solar panels and collect water in our dam during the monsoon which keeps us going for the whole year.</p>
